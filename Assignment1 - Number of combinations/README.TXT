Implement, through dynamic programming, the number of combinations according to the following recursive formula:

1.- Combination Formula.

2.- Then we added recursive programming.

3.- Finally we added dynamic programming. 


We'll take special care with the declaration, initialization and use of the buffer table. 
In addition, we must compare the results of implementing the recursive implementation 
of the same algorithm and an implementation based on the factorial calculation. 
The execution time of the program will also be compared.
